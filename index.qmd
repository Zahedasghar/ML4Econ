## Course Description:

This course provides an introduction to machine learning and related methods for big data from an economics perspective. Students will learn modern estimation methods for high-dimensional data, with a focus on causal inference and prediction problems in economics, business, and related fields. Through programming assignments and a final empirical project, students will apply machine learning techniques to real-world data. Using Generative AI (ChatGPT, Google Colab,...) and other tools will be part of the course to enhance the learning experience.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

- Apply machine learning methods to estimate causal effects in experimental and observational settings.
- Solve prediction problems in economics using machine learning techniques.
- Understand the uses, strengths, and limitations of machine learning for answering economic questions.
- Implement machine learning algorithms using Python/R.
- Analyze and interpret economic data using machine learning methods.
- Conduct an empirical research project utilizing machine learning techniques.
