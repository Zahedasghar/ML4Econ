# Integrating Machine Learning into Economics

---

## Introduction

- **Appreciation for Machine Learning**
  - Gained from experience in technology
- **Evolution in Economics**
  - Initially rare in economics and social sciences
  - Now prevalent in PhD dissertations

---

## Traditional Economics Research

- **Empirical Focus**
  - Use of data with models
  - Often on small datasets
- **Policy Questions**
  - Emphasis on cause and effect
  - Examples:
    - Impact of raising prices
    - Effects of increasing minimum wage

---

## Early Machine Learning Focus

- **Prediction and Classification**
  - Classifying images (e.g., cats vs. dogs)
  - Reliance on labeled datasets
- **Black Box Models**
  - Performance measured by accuracy on test data
  - Limited understanding of underlying processes

---

## Gap Between ML and Economics

- **Different Objectives**
  - ML: Prediction accuracy
  - Economics: Causal inference and "what-if" scenarios
- **Challenges**
  - Lack of tools addressing causal questions in ML
  - Difficulty in assessing unseen counterfactuals

---

## Bridging the Gap

- **Developed Conceptual Frameworks**
  - Connected ML innovations with economic research needs
- **Created Tools and Software**
  - Personalized policy development
  - Widely adopted by social scientists and tech firms
- **Applications**
  - Reanalyzing experiments
  - Administrative data analysis

---

## Applications of Integrated ML

- **Personalized Medicine**
  - Administer drugs to those who benefit most
- **Economic Policies**
  - Assess effects of layoffs on different demographics
- **Industry Adoption**
  - Integration into A/B testing platforms
  - Improved decision-making in tech companies

---

## Promoting Interdisciplinary Collaboration

- **Recognized Need**
  - Engineers understanding social implications
  - Ethicists contributing to technological solutions
- **Approach**
  - Solve real problems collaboratively
  - Engage deeply across disciplines
- **Outcomes**
  - Better handling of content moderation
  - Addressing differential impacts on groups

## Human-Centered AI Institute

- **Establishment**
  - Founded at Stanford in 2017
- **Vision**
  - Advance AI research responsibly
  - Focus on ethics and societal impact
- **Goals**
  - Foster interdisciplinary research
  - Educate on responsible AI use

---

## Educational Initiatives

- **Identified Gaps in Learning**
  - Engineers lacked exposure to real-world problems
- **Curriculum Development**
  - Combined technical skills with domain knowledge
- **Student Outcomes**
  - Better prepared for industry challenges
  - More holistic understanding of AI applications

---

## Conclusion

- **Integration is Key**
  - Combining ML with economics enhances both fields
- **Multidisciplinary Approaches**
  - Essential for responsible AI development
